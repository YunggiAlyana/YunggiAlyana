## 🧠 About Me

- **Curious and analytical:** I enjoy reverse-engineering things to learn how they work.  
- **Aesthetic-driven:** Clean UI and smooth UX matter as much as functionality.  
- **Problem-solver by nature:** I like simplifying manual work through automation (even at my day job in retail).  
- **Lifelong learner:** I’m currently learning more about data visualization, backend architecture, and deployment.
